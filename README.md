# Mental-Health-Monitoring-System
This project is a Mental Health Monitoring System that uses Google Fit API to fetch heart rate variability (HRV) data and assesses mental health based on both physiological and environmental factors. The application uses the Tkinter library for creating a user-friendly graphical interface and leverages Python.
